## Color Palette Used

- **Dark Red**: `#c62828` - Used for text and darker elements
- **Very Dark Red**: `#b71c1c` - Used for headings and hover states
- **Light Red**: `#e57373` - Used for borders and lighter accents
- **Very Light Red**: `#ffcdd2` - Used for backgrounds and cards
- **Ultra Light Red**: `#ffebee` - Used for page background and light elements
- **Darkest Red**: `#a00000` - Used for very dark hover states

## Implementation Details

### CSS Strategy
1. **Cascading Order**: CSS files are loaded in this order:
   - Bootstrap (base styles)
   - site.css (custom overrides)
   - red-theme-override.css (comprehensive red theme)
   - Layout-specific CSS (final overrides)

2. **Specificity**: Used `!important` declarations to ensure red theme takes precedence over Bootstrap defaults

3. **Coverage**: Targeted all Bootstrap components and custom elements:
   - Navigation elements
   - Buttons and forms
   - Cards and containers
   - Tables and lists
   - Interactive elements (modals, dropdowns, etc.)

### UI Elements Affected
- **Navigation Bar**: Light red background with dark red text and links
- **Buttons**: All button types (primary, secondary, success, warning, etc.) now use red variants
- **Cards**: Light red backgrounds with red borders and dark red text
- **Forms**: Red borders and focus states for all input elements
- **Tables**: Red headers with light red borders
- **Links**: Red color with darker red hover states
- **Alerts**: Red-themed backgrounds and borders
- **Badges**: Red background with white text
- **Progress Bars**: Red fill color
- **Modals**: Red-themed headers and borders

## Testing
To see the changes:
1. Run the application using `dotnet run` in the `/RestaurantOps.Legacy/` directory
2. Navigate to any page to see the red theme applied
3. All UI interactions (hover states, focus, active states) will use red color variants

## Browser Compatibility
The CSS uses standard properties and should work across all modern browsers. The color scheme is consistent and accessible with good contrast ratios.

## Maintenance
- To adjust the red theme, modify the color variables in `red-theme-override.css`
- To revert to original colors, remove or comment out the red theme CSS file reference in `_Layout.cshtml`
- Individual components can be fine-tuned by modifying the specific selectors in the CSS files
